Explain the overall use of the package ?
Numpy.random creates pseudo random numbers.
This stems from the fact that it is used as part of a calculation.It is only pseudo random and not true random due to the fact that the number is calculated from an algorithim.
This leads pseduo random numbers being less useful for security as any random number created from an algorithim can be calculated directly from the same algorithim.[1]
Any simulation of real life events require a random number to be generated[2].Random sampling is vital for seeing the true effects of data and the accuracy of the data[3]
The numpy.random package creates predictable arrays which allowes the data to be compared on an appropriate level.

Explain the use of sample random data and permutation function.The permutation package allows for the reordering of an array
